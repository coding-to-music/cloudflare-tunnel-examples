# cloudflare-tunnel-examples

Create a Tunnel with the name provided and associate it with a UUID. The relationship between the UUID and the name is persistent. The command will not create a connection at this point.

The created Tunnel can serve traffic for multiple hostnames in your Cloudflare account and send traffic to multiple services available to cloudflared, including SSH, RDP, and most arbitrary TCP connections.

# Set up your first tunnel

https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/blob/production/content/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide.md

title: Set up your first tunnel

When setting up your first Cloudflare Tunnel, you have the option to create it:

- [Remotely on the Zero Trust dashboard](#set-up-a-tunnel-remotely-dashboard-setup)
- [Locally, using your CLI](#set-up-a-tunnel-locally-cli-setup)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

- [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Creating-a-Cloudflare-account-and-adding-a-website).
- [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708).

First, download `cloudflared` on your machine. Visit the [downloads](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/) page to find the right package for your OS.

Next, install `cloudflared`.

#### .deb install

Use the deb package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines. `amd64 / x86-64` is used in this example.

```sh
wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb && dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
```

#### â€‹.rpm install

Use the rpm package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines. `amd64 / x86-64` is used in this example.

```sh
wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-x86_64.rpm
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Build from source</summary>
<div>

You can also build the latest version of `cloudflared` from source with the following steps.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared.git
cd cloudflared
make cloudflared
go install github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/cmd/cloudflared
```

Depending on where you installed `cloudflared`, you can move it to a known path as well.

```bash
mv /root/cloudflared/cloudflared /usr/bin/cloudflared
```

</div>
</details>

### 2. Authenticate `cloudflared`

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

Running this command will:

- Open a browser window and prompt you to log in to your Cloudflare account. After logging in to your account, select your hostname.
- Generate an account certificate, the [cert.pem file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#cert-pem), in the [default `cloudflared` directory](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#default-cloudflared-directory).

### 3. Create a tunnel and give it a name

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>
```

Running this command will:

- Create a tunnel by establishing a persistent relationship between the [name you provide](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#tunnel-name) and a [UUID](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#tunnel-uuid) for your tunnel. At this point, no connection is active within the tunnel yet.
- Generate a [tunnel credentials file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#credentials-file) in the [default `cloudflared` directory](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#default-cloudflared-directory).
- Create a subdomain of `.cfargotunnel.com`.

From the output of the command, take note of the tunnelâ€™s UUID and the path to your tunnelâ€™s credentials file.

Confirm that the tunnel has been successfully created by running:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel list
```

### 4. Create a configuration file

Create a [configuration file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#configuration-file) in your `.cloudflared` directory using any text editor. This file will configure the tunnel to route traffic from a given origin to the hostname of your choice.

Add the following fields to the file:

**If you are connecting an application**

```txt
url: http://localhost:8000
tunnel: <Tunnel-UUID>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<Tunnel-UUID>.json
```

**If you are connecting a network**

```txt
tunnel: <Tunnel-UUID>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<Tunnel-UUID>.json
warp-routing:
  enabled: true
```

Confirm that the configuration file has been successfully created by running:

```bash
cat config.yml
```

### 5. Start routing traffic

Now assign a CNAME record that points traffic to your tunnel subdomain.

**If you are connecting an application**

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns <UUID or NAME> <hostname>
```

**If you are connecting a network**

Add the IP/CIDR you would like to be routed through the tunnel.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route ip add <IP/CIDR> <UUID or NAME>
```

You can confirm that the route has been successfully established by running:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route ip show
```

### 6. Run the tunnel

Run the tunnel to proxy incoming traffic from the tunnel to any number of services running locally on your origin.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run <UUID or NAME>
```

If your configuration file has a custom name or is not in the `.cloudflared` directory, add the `--config` flag and specify the path.

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --config /path/your-config-file.yaml run
```

{{<Aside>}}

Cloudflare Tunnel can install itself as a system service on Linux and Windows and as a launch agent on macOS. For more information, refer to [Run as a service](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/run-tunnel/as-a-service/).

{{</Aside>}}

### 7. Check the tunnel

Your tunnel configuration is complete! If you want to get information on the tunnel you just created, you can run:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel info
```

## Create a Tunnel

To create a Tunnel, run the following command:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>
```

Replace `<NAME>` with the name you want to give to the Tunnel. The name assigned can be any string and does not need to relate to the hostname where traffic will be served.

This command will create a Tunnel with the name provided and associate it with a UUID. The relationship between the UUID and the name is persistent. The command will not create a connection at this point.

The created Tunnel can serve traffic for multiple hostnames in your Cloudflare account and send traffic to multiple services available to `cloudflared`, including SSH, RDP, and most arbitrary TCP connections.

![Create a tunnel](https://github.com/coding-to-music/cloudflare-tunnel-examples/blob/main/images/ct1.png?raw=true)

Creating a Tunnel generates a credentials file for that specific Tunnel. This file is distinct from the cert.pem file. To run the Tunnel without managing DNS from `cloudflared`, you only need the credentials file.

| Route traffic to a running Tunnel<br/>from the Cloudflare dashboard | Available  | Available        |

{{</table-wrap>}}

## List available Tunnels

`cloudflared` can list all created Tunnels in your account, as well as those actively connected to Cloudflare, by running the following command:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel list
```

Note: the command requires the `cert.pem` file.

![List tunnels](https://github.com/coding-to-music/cloudflare-tunnel-examples/blob/main/images/lt1.png?raw=true)

## Revoke and delete a Tunnel

You can delete an existing Tunnel with cloudflared. To delete a Tunnel, run the following command:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel delete <NAME>
```

{{<Aside>}}

The command requires the `cert.pem` file.

{{</Aside>}}

If there are still active connections on that Tunnel, then you will have to force the deletion with:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel delete -f <NAME>
```

This will cause those connections to be dropped.

Deleting the Tunnel also invalidates the credentials file associated with that Tunnel, meaning those connections can not be re-established.

{{<Aside>}}

Tunnels created in this method do not currently display in the **Traffic** tab of the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com). These connections will be added to the dashboard in a future release.

{{</Aside>}}

Cloudflare Tunnel deletes DNS records after 24-48 hours of a Tunnel being unregistered. Cloudflare Tunnel does not delete TLS certificates on your behalf once the Tunnel is shut down. If you want to clean up a Tunnel youâ€™ve shut down, you can delete DNS records [in the DNS editor](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?zone=dns) and revoke TLS certificates in the Origin Certificates section of the [SSL/TLS tab of the Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/origin).
